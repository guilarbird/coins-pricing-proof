      "question": "Why does IOF vary?",
      "answer": "IOF (Tax on Financial Operations) is a Brazilian statutory tax that varies based on transaction structure and purpose. Rates range from 0.38% to 6.38%. For Brazil-bound transfers, IOF is applied transparently where legally required (e.g., 3.5% for certain remittance types)."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How is FX pricing determined?",
      "answer": "Coins.xyz pricing is market-based, derived from live order books and institutional liquidity providers. Typical FX spreads range from 5–15 bps depending on transaction size and market conditions. Spread is always shown explicitly — no hidden markups."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How does execution work?",
      "answer": "Coins.xyz operates a Digital FX execution model. You request a quote (RFQ), pricing is formed from live liquidity, the trade is executed, and settlement occurs via on-chain rails. This reduces intermediary layers compared to correspondent banking."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What is on-chain settlement?",
      "answer": "On-chain settlement uses digital assets as the final execution layer for cross-border FX. Rather than relying on correspondent banking networks (Nostro/Vostro accounts), settlement occurs directly on-chain — reducing operational opacity and structural costs."
