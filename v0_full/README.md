# v0 Full Import

This folder contains the complete v0 project structure imported from the v0 ZIP.
It is isolated and does not affect the main Vite build.

## Structure
- `components/` - UI components from v0
- `lib/` - Utilities and helpers from v0
- `app/` - Next.js app directory (reference only)
- `public/` - Assets from v0

## Note
This is a reference import. The main app continues to use Vite + React.
